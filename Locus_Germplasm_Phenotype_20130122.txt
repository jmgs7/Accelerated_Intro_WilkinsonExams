Visible differences  between wild-type and mea-1 embryos  began at the late globular stage. Globular mea-1 embryos show excess  cell proliferation and enlarge radially  symmetrical. When wild-type embryos  reach the mid to late heart stage, sibling  mea-1 embryos are still globular and contain  small vacuolated cells with curvilinear cell  walls and sometimes irregular cell divisions  in the ground tissue and procambium. Suspensor  and hypophysis are normal, and cotyledons  initiate synchronously as in the  wild type. Thus, despite increased cell proliferation  and occasional irregular cytokinesis,  morphogenetic progression is normal.  However, each stage is prolonged and includes  more division cycles, and morphogenesis  is delayed. As a consequence, giant  heart stage mea-1 embryos  are present along with late torpedo or cotyledonary  stage wild-type embryos. mea-1  heart stage embryos have supernumerary  cell layers. When wild-type siblings are  fully differentiated, most mea-1 embryos  have reached the late heart stage and are up  to 10 times larger than normal. mea embryos  degenerate during desiccation. These results  suggest that mea controls cell proliferation  during embryogenesis, allowing morphogenesis  to progress normally, albeit  slowly.  Endosperm development in mea-1 seeds  is indistinguishable from that of the wild  type at early stages. When cellularization  begins normally in wild-type seeds at the  transition from the globular to the heart  stage, no cellularization is observed in sibling  mea-1 seeds. Although nuclear divisions  take place more slowly in mea-1 endosperm,  the distribution of endosperm nuclei  is as in the wild type. Partial cellularization  occurs at the micropyle when mea-1  embryos reach the late heart stage in desiccating  seeds, but because fewer nuclei have  been generated, most of the centra\t9545225","AT1G02580\tmea-1\tThe homozygous progeny is embryo-lethal.\t9545225","AT1G02580\tmea-2\tMutant homozygous mea embryo  sacs accumulated 45 times more maternal transcripts  than wild-type before fertilization,  and it persisted after fertilization (7.5 times more transcripts  4 d after pollination.","\t16651654","","AT1G02580\tmea-2\tSimilar to non-revertant mea-1 mutant.\t9545225","AT1G02580\tmea-2\tThe homozygous progeny is embryo-lethal.\t9545225","AT1G02860\tbah1-D\tExhibits spontaneous cell death in leaves after bolting and increased salicylic acid levels and localized cell death after inoculation with Pst DC3000.\t18753285","AT1G02860\tnla\tIn contrast to wild type, anthocyanin accumulation did not occur in the senescing mutant rosette leaves.\t17355433","AT1G02860\tnla\tMutants failed to adapt to the conditions of nitrogen limitation and started senescence much earlier and more rapidly than did wild-type plants supplied with 3 mM nitrate: mutant plants supplied with 10 mM nitrate had a similar pattern of growth and development to wild type.

Homozygous mutants had poorly developed siliques with a few or no seeds, compared with heterozygous mutant or wild type siliques that were fully filled with seeds. Flowers on the homozygous sterile plants were often slightly smaller and open for considerably longer periods than wild type, and a majority of them (80 to 90%) remained unfertilized. Otherwise, mutant plants revealed only mild very morphological and developmental phenotypes. The anthers from the sterile plants were often smaller, more heart shaped, and contained fewer pollen grains compared with wild type anthers, which were somewhat oblong and fully filled with pollen In addition, the mutant pollen grains were slightly larger than wild type. Because the mutant stamens often had shorter filaments than the wild type self-pollination was seldom efficient. However, upon manual pollination, pollen from the homozygous mutant plants germinated on self or wild type stigmas and produced fertile seeds, indicating that the mutant pollen grains, although larger, were viable. When homozygous mutant plant was pollinated with wild type pollen, the cross-pollination resulted in near normal development of siliques and production of seeds suggesting that the female development was not affected by the arp4-1 mutation. Sterility in the homozygous mutant plants is the result of production of fewer pollen and inefficient self-pollination.

Microscopic observation revealed highly disordered root meristem cell patterns, with most walls lacking parallel or perpendicular alignment to the longitudinal axis of the root and most cells exhibiting irregular shapes. Examination of cell wall patterns suggested that misoriented cell divisions were largely responsible for the irregular cell patterns. In pok1/pok2 double mutant embryos, misplaced cell walls were observed as early as the octant stage of embryogenesis. Throughout embryogenesis, the mispositioning of cell walls continues, eventually giving rise to slightly misshapen mature embryos with a stubby appearance, compared to wild-type.

In some cases, no petals or filaments were observed at the position of petal formation.","\t14681191","","AT5G06070\tCS6395\tThe epidermal cells on the lower surface of the filaments of rbe-1 had an irregular ridged structure similar to that of the lower surface of the wild type, but the cells were flattened and elliptic. The position of the filamentous petals was normal; that is, they were formed in the second whorl at a position between the medial and lateral sepals. Furthermore, in the small or spoon-shaped petals of rbe-1, the epidermal cells had a ridged structure and were smaller . This suggests that the position and identity of the aberrant-shaped petals of rbe was not altered.","\t14681191","","AT5G06070\tCS6396\tDefective in petal development; petals are transformed to filamentous organs, or lost; ovules have shorter integuments than those of wild type, producing shorter siliques; reduced fertility; strong allele.\t14681191","AT5G06070\tCS6939\tDefective in sepal, petal, and ovule development; flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals; petals are often reduced in size or altered  in appearance, petals often absent or replaced by staminoid organs and filaments; altered integument growth in ovules; reduced fertility.\t16412084","AT5G06070\tCS6939\tDuring stage 3 of flower development, four sepal primordia are initiated in normal positions in rbe-3 mutants. However, early in stage 4 some rbe-3 sepal primordia have undergone extra growth along their margins and appear wider than normal. The tips of these primordia were sometimes not located in the middle of the primordia and the two sides of the primordia were not symmetrical. Continued uneven growth of these primordia became more pronounced during development.

In rbe-3 flowers with more than four sepals, the extra sepal was thinner than the remaining four sepals. In some cases, one of the adjacent sepals was  also somewhat reduced in width. Sepal fusion can occur in the absence of more than four sepals. Sepal fusion was observed most often at the base of these organs and more rarely along their entire length. We measured the width of mature sepals to determine whether  sepal fusion might be due to wider organs. rbe-3 sepals were 12% wider than Landsberg erecta (Ler) sepals at maturity.\t16412084","AT5G06070\tag-1 rbe-3\tSame phenotype as ag-1 single mutants with completely normal petals developing in the second whorl.

However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.","\t17351828","","AT5G46700\ttrn2-23010 wus-1\tWhereas carpels were completely absent in wus-1 flowers and only 1.6 stamens (compared to 6 in wild type) developed in the third floral whorl, all trn2-23010 wus-1 flowers developed 2 carpels, which in contrast to trn2-23010 single mutants were seldom open (33%) and more usually fused. Consistent with the increased number of stamens (4.2 on average) in the third floral whorl, the trn2 mutation may compensate for a premature consumption of stem cells in wus-1 flowers. In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers.","\t17351828","","AT5G46830\tatnig1-1\tatnig1-1 plants show reduced survival rate, fresh weight,  chlorophyll content, and protein content under salt stress.","\t16962584","","AT5G46860\tSALK_075924\tThe morphology of mutant plants was similar and to some extend weaker than ssm plants.
